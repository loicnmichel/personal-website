abstract: "© 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved. The whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, is a long-lived fish of high commercial importance in the western Atlantic Ocean. Here, we used stable isotope ratios of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen and isotopic niche metrics (SIBER) to study feeding habits and track habitat use by whitemouth croakers in Guanabara Bay, an estuary in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Our results highlighted size-related habitat segregation, with small juvenile fishes ( textless 30 cm) residing mostly inside estuaries and large adult fishes ( textgreater 60 cm) feeding mainly in Continental Shelf waters. Medium adult fishes (30–60 cm) appear to feed in multiple coastal and Continental Shelf habitats. Moreover, their feeding ecology sh owed strong temporal differences, linked with seasonal and, to a lesser extent, interannual variation in oceanographic features of the ecosystem in which they live. Overall, these differences in ecological features suggest that (1) adult and juvenile whitemouth croakers should be treated as different components of the food web and (2) the conservation of these habitats should be prioritized to better manage and sustain the coastal fisheries in Guanabara Bay."
