abstract: "The fin whale (*Balaenoptera physalus*) is the most abundant and widespread mysticete species in the Mediterranean
Sea, found mostly over deep, offshore waters of the western and central portion of the region. In the Mediterranean,
this species is known to feed mainly on krill, in contrast to its Atlantic counterpart, which displays a more diversified
diet. The International Whaling Commission recognizes several managements units in the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean Sea and the connectivity between these populations is still being debated. Questions remain about
inter-individual feeding strategies and trophic ecology. The goal of this study was to compare isotopic niches of fin
whales from the Mediterranean Sea and the Celtic Sea (North Atlantic). δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N values were analysed in 136 skin biopsies from free-ranging Mediterranean fin whales sampled in 2010 and 2011 during campaigns at sea. δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N values ranged from -20.4 to -17.1 ‰ and from 5.9 to 8.9 ‰, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those estimated previously from baleen plates from Mediterranean and North Atlantic fin whales. The
narrow isotopic niche width of the Mediterranean fin whale (Standard Ellipse Area, SEA<sub>C</sub>) compared to the North
Atlantic fin whale raises many concerns in the context of global changes and long-term consequences. One could
indeed expect that species displaying narrow niches would be more susceptible to ecosystem fragmentation and other
anthropogenic impacts."
