abstract: "In the Kerguelen Islands, the multiple effects of climate change are expected to impact
coastal marine habitats. Species distribution models (SDM) can represent a convenient
tool to predict the biogeographic response of species to climate change but biotic
interactions are not considered in these models. Nevertheless, new species interactions
can emerge in communities exposed to environmental changes and the structure of
biotic interactions is directly related to the potential resilience of ecosystems. Trophic
interaction studies can help predict species vulnerability to environmental changes using
carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and nitrogen (δ<sup>15</sup>N) stable isotope ratios to generate trophic models. Using
new available data inputs, we generated robust SDM and trophic interaction models to
assess the potential response and sensitivity of three echinoid species to future worst-case
scenarios of environmental change in the Kerguelen Plateau region. The two modelling
approaches provide contrasting insights into the potential responses of each species to
future environmental changes with both approaches identifying Abatus cordatus to be
particularly vulnerable due to its narrow ecological niche and endemism to near-shore
areas. Coupling insights gained from trophic niche ecology with species distribution
modelling represents a promising approach that can improve our understanding and
ability to predict the potential responses of species to future habitat changes."
