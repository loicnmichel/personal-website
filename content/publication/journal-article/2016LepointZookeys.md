abstract: "Background: The seagrass *Posidonia oceanica* L. Delile, commonly known as Neptune grass, is an endemic species of the Mediterranean Sea. It hosts a distinctive and diverse epiphytic community, dominated by various macroalgal and animal organisms. Mediterranean bryozoans have been extensively studied but quantitative data assessing temporal and spatial variability have rarely been documented. In Lepoint et al. (2014a, b) occurrence and abundance data of epiphytic bryozoan communities on leaves of *P. oceanica* inhabiting Revellata Bay (Corsica, Mediterranean Sea) were reported and trophic ecology of *Electra posidoniae* Gautier assessed.
New information: Here, metadata information is provided on the data set discussed in Lepoint et al. (2014a) and published on the GBIF portal as a sampling-event data set: [http://ipt.biodiversity.be/resource?r=ulg_bryozoa&v=1.0](http://ipt.biodiversity.be/resource?r=ulg_bryozoa&v=1.0). The data set is enriched by data concerning species settled on *Posidonia* scales (dead petiole of Posidonia leaves, remaining after limb abscission)."
