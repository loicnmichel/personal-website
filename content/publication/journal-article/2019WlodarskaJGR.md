abstract: "Fjords have been recently recognized as hot spots of organic carbon (C<sub>org</sub>)
  sequestration in marine sediments. This study aims to identify regional and local
  drivers of variability of C<sub>org</sub> burial in north Atlantic and Arctic fjords.
  We provide a comparative quantiﬁcation of C<sub>org</sub>, δ<sup>13</sup>C, photosynthetic
  pigments content, benthic biomass, consumption, C<sub>org</sub> accumulation, and
  burial rates in sediments in six fjords (60–81°N). Higher sediment C<sub>org</sub>
  content in southern Norway reﬂected longer phytoplankton growth season and higher
  productivity. Higher contributions of terrestrial C<sub>org</sub> were noted in
  temperate/southern Norway (dense land vegetation and high precipitation) and Arctic/Svalbard
  (glacial erosion) than in subarctic/northern Norway locations. Benthic biomass and
  carbon consumption were best correlated to δ<sup>13</sup>C and photosynthetic pigments
  content indicating control by quality rather than quantity of available food. Benthic
  faunal consumption did not seem to affect the variability in C<sub>org</sub> burial.
  Regional environmental factors (water temperature and latitude) combined with local
  factors (C<sub>org</sub>, grain size, and pigment concentration) explained 94% of
  C<sub>org</sub> burial variability. Based on the present study and literature data
  on C<sub>org</sub> content, origin, and burial rates, the fjords were classified into four categories: temperate, subarctic, Arctic with glaciers, and Arctic without
  glaciers. The variability in marine productivity, terrestrial inﬂows, and carbon
  sequestration in fjords must be considered for global estimates of their role in
  blue carbon storage and for building scenarios of future changes in the course of
  climate warming."
