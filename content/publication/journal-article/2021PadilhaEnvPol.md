abstract: "Contaminant levels are lower in Antarctica than elsewhere in the world because of its low anthropogenic activities. However, the northern region of the Antarctic Peninsula, is close to South America and experiences the greatest anthropogenic pressure in Antarctica. Here, we investigated, in two Antarctic Peninsula islands, intra and interspecific factors that influence the concentrations of 17 trace elements (TEs) in blood and feathers of three penguin species breeding sympatrically in relation to their trophic ecology assessed via a stable isotopic approach (C, N and S). Geographical location, foraging zone (δ13C and δ34S) and diet influences the interspecific difference, and sex and maturity stage diet influence the intraspecific difference of Pygoscelis penguins. Penguins from Livingston showed higher values (mean, ng. g−1, dry weight - dw) of Zn (103), Mn (0.3), and Fe (95) than those from King George Island (Zn: 80, Mn: 1.9, and Fe: 11). Gender-related differences were observed, as males showed significantly higher values (mean, ng. g−1, dw) of Rb (3.4) and δ15N in blood of gentoo, and Ca (1344) in Adélie feathers. Chicks of gentoo and Adélie presented higher Zn, Mg, Ca, and Sr and lower 13C values in blood than adults. The highest concentrations (mean, ng. g−1, dw) of Cd (0.2) and Cu (26), and the lowest δ15N values were found in chinstrap. Geographical, intraspecific (i.e., ontogenetic and gender-related) and interspecific differences in feeding seemed to have influenced TE and stable isotope values in these animals. The TE bioaccumulation by penguins may have also been influenced by natural enrichment in environmental levels of these elements, which seems to be the case for Fe, Zn, and Mn. However, the high level of some of the TEs (Mn, Cd, and Cr) may reflect the increase of local and global human activities."
