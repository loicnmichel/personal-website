abstract: "Mediterranean *Posidonia oceanica* meadows shelter an important biomass and biodiversity of
amphipod crustaceans that graze on epiphytes. However, their actual significance for ecosystem functional
processes is hard to estimate, due to the lack of adequate data. Here, a field microcosm-based inclusion experiment
was used to test if three of the dominant taxa of the amphipod community (*Apherusa chiereghinii*, *Dexamine
spiniventris* and *Gammarus* spp.) could exert top-down control on seagrass leaf epiphytes. Influence of amphipod
activity on nutrient availability for the host species was also investigated. All grazer taxa significantly reduced
biomasses of erect macroalgae and erect sessile animals present on leaves. None of them consumed encrusting
epiflora or epifauna. This selective top-down control could have important implications for the structure of the
epiphytic community on leaves of *P. oceanica*, which is one of the most diverse and abundant of all seagrass
species. Grazing activity of all taxa caused higher N content of seagrass leaves, likely through amphipod
excretion and/or sloppy feeding. Since *P. oceanica* meadows often grow in oligotrophic zones where plant
growth can be nutrient-limited, this N enrichment could enhance seagrass production. Overall, the ecological
interaction between *P. oceanica* and amphipods could be seen as a facultative mutualistic relationship. Our
results suggest that amphipod mesograzers are key-elements in some of the functional processes regulating
these complex and yet endangered ecosystems, which are essential components of Mediterranean coastal zones."
