abstract: "The by-the-wind sailor *Velella velella* (Linnaeus, 1758) and its predator, the violet snail *Janthina
globosa* (Swainson, 1822) are both floating neustonic organisms. Despite their global oceanic distribution and
widespread blooms of *V. velella* in recent years, many gaps remain in our understanding about prey/predator
interactions between these two taxa. Using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen, we aimed to study the
trophic relationship between *V. velella* and *J. globosa* and investigate diet variation of *V. velella* and *J. globosa*
in relation to individuals’ size. Bayesian approaches were used to calculate isotopic niche metrics and the
contribution of *V. velella* to the *J. globosa* diet. Our data showed that the isotopic niche of *V. velella* differed
markedly from that of *J. globosa*. It was larger and did not overlap that of the *J. globosa*, indicating a more
variable diet but at a lower trophic level than *J. globosa*. The isotopic niche of *V. velella* also varied according
to the size class of the individual. Small individuals showed a larger isotopic niche than larger animals and
low overlap with those of the larger individuals. *J. globosa* displayed very low isotopic variability and very
small isotopic niches. In contrast, there were no isotopic composition nor isotopic niche differences between
*J. globosa* of any size. This very low isotopic variability suggested that *J. globosa* is a specialist predator,
feeding, at least in this aggregation, principally on *V. velella*. Moreover, outputs of a stable isotope mixing
model revealed preferential feeding on medium to large (> 500 mm²) *V. velella* colonies. While our isotopic data
showed the trophic relationship between *V. velella* and *J. globosa*, many questions remain about the ecology of
these two organisms, demonstrating the need for more fundamental studies about neustonic ecosystems."
