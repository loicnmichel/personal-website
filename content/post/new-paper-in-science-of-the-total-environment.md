New paper out! For this one, we (lead by [Ana Carolina Pizzochero](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ana_Pizzochero)) investigated how biological parameters and ecological habits influenced contamination by legacy and emerging organic pollutants (including chlorinated and brominated flame retardants, dioxins, and furans) in whitemouth croakers (a.k.a. corvinas,Â _Micropogonas furnieri_) from Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. This species is one of the most commercially important species along the Atlantic coast of South America, making its contamination a matter of public health.
