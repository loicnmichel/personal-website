We just received the amazing news that our project ARDECO (Assessing Resilience of DEep COrals) was selected for funding by the [French National Research Agency (ANR)](https://anr.fr/en/). For this 4-year (2021-2025) project, alongside colleagues from Sorbonne Université (FR), Océanopolis (FR), University of Aveiro (PO), and Memorial University of Newfoundland (CA), we'll be combining in situ sampling and observations with ex situ experiments in pressurized aquaria to understand how global change might impact multiple aspects of deep-sea coral biology. We will focus on the Bay of Biscay, where several coral species (*Desmophyllum pertusum*, *Madrepora oculata*, and *Solenosmilia variabilis*) form reefs at depths between 650 and 2000 m. I'll be in charge of a work package about coral feeding and energy acquisition. Stay tuned for more info once the project starts...
