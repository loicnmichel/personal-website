From 06/05 to 07/06, I took part in the second leg of the Chubacarc research cruise. Onboard RV L'Atalante, we spent 4 (intense) weeks sampling fauna in deep-sea hydrothermal vents from back-arc basins in the Pacific Ocean. The campaign was a success, as we not only come home with hundreds of samples, but also discovered a new vent field (stay tuned for more info about that soon-ish). I learned a lot of new things, as it was my first deep-sea cruise, and my first time sampling with a ROV. I could not have hoped for a better first experience,Â  and I'm grateful to fellow scientists, but also to the ROV staff and ship crew for their crucial part in the mission's smooth operations.
