Our paper entitled "**Is the trophic diversity of marine benthic consumers decoupled from taxonomic and functional trait diversity? Isotopic niches of Arctic communities**" just came out in Limnology and Oceanography. In this paper, lead by IOPAN's [Maria Włodarska‐Kowalczuk](http://www.iopan.gda.pl/ekologia/mwk/mwk.html), we looked at how environmental perturbations (here, glacier melting) influenced benthic diversity in Arctic fjords. Our results suggest that glacially impacted areas have a lower specific and functional diversity, but that impoverished communities living there occupy a similar isotopic niche and have comparable trophic diversity. We discuss of what could cause this situation, and how it is important for community resilience to environmental change. Check it out at [doi.org/10.1002/lno.11174](http://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11174)
