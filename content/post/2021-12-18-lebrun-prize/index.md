Christmas came early this year, and apparently I was on the right list, as the [Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium](https://www.academieroyale.be/) awarded me the 2021 [Jean Lebrun](https://archives.africamuseum.be/agents/people/186) prize for my work on impacts of anthropogenic impacts on ecosystem functioning, and my contribution to the study of marine food webs.

This triennial prize, awarded for the 12th time since its creation in 1986, rewards research work performed in the field of ecology and/or biogeography. Although I was slightly bummed out that the official ceremony was held online for sanitary reasons, I am thrilled to see my work recognized. As a cherry on top of the cake, two old friends were also rewarded by the Academy: [Alice Mouton](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mouton-Alice) and [Nicolas Sturaro](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas-Sturaro).
