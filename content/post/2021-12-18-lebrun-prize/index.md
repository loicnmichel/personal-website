Right on time for the holiday break, our newest paper is out in Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene. It was lead by [Gustavo Yunda-Guarin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gustavo_Yunda-Guarin), as part of his PhD research at Laval University (Qu√©bec, Canada). It is part of the [Green Edge project](http://www.greenedgeproject.info/) special issue.

For this paper, we combined stable isotopes and lipid trophic markers to show that sea ice-derived production is an important energy source for deep-sea benthos in the Canadian Arctic. This suggests that changes in spring sea ice phenology could alter benthic food-web structure. Read the full story at https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2020.047
