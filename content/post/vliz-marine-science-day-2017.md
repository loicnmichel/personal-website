The [VLIZ (Flanders Marine Institute)](http://www.vliz.be/) organized the [2017 edition of its annual Marine Science Day](http://www.vliz.be/vmsd/en/VMSD17) on Friday 03/03 in Bruges. I was selected to give a talk in the afternoon. Slots were very short (5 minutes), which provided a challenging but interesting experience. Overall, the scientific quality was impressive, and the organisation was flawless (as always with VLIZ). A very enjoyable day and an excellent networking opportunity. Looking forward for the 2018 edition!
