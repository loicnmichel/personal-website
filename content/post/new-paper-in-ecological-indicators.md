A new paper in collaboration with our Polish colleagues, entitled "[Modification of benthic food web structure by recovering seagrass meadows, as revealed by trophic markers and mixing models](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.02.054)" just came out in Ecological Indicators.

For this one, we combined stable isotopes and fatty acid trophic markers in a quantitative mixing model, to evaluate how presence of seagrass meadows influences food webs in the coastal Baltic Sea. You can read the paper here: [http://hdl.handle.net/2268/221262](http://hdl.handle.net/2268/221262)
