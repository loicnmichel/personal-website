Our paper about differences in niche width in populations of fin whales from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and the implications for conservation biology just came out in Marine Environmental Research. It's entitled "[Isotopic niches of fin whales from the Mediterranean Sea and the Celtic Sea (North Atlantic)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.03.009)", it was lead by [Krishna Das](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Krishna_Das), and I was in charge of the isotopic niche modelling.
