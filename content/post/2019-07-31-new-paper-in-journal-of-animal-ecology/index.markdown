New paper about Antarctic seabirds, lead by [Nina Dehnhard](https://ninadehnhard.wordpress.com/), just out in Journal of Animal Ecology. We combined GPS logging and stable isotopes to understand how Antarcticaâ€™s tremendous seasonal variability affected habitat and food segregation among closely related and sympatrically breeding species. Results suggest that all three species have a generalist behaviour and exhibit considerable isotopic niche overlap. This might be explained by the optimal foraging theory: in a very productive but highly variable such as coastal Antarctica, being a generalist, although it increases risks of interspecific competition, might be essential to efficiently exploit mobile prey stocks.<br>
