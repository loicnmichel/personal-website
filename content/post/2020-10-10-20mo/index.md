Last weekend (03-05/10/2020), alongside many Ifremer and Oc√©anopolis colleagues, we hosted the "20 Mo under the seas" event at the Ateliers de Capucins (Brest, FR). During those 3 days, we could, through a combination of short talks, photos, videos, games and virtual reality experiences, present our deep-sea research activities and the technical means we need to implement it to people from all ages and horizons. Despite a challenging organization due to the current sanitary context, it's been a rewarding opportunity to share our science with a wider audience than usual.
