[Gilles Lepoint](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gilles_Lepoint) and I are just back from lovely Utrecht (The Netherlands), where we attended the 2017 Symposium of the [Benelux Association of Stable Isotope Scientists](http://www.basis-online.eu/en/). As always, it was a very convivial meeting, and a great opportunity to meet with peopled involved in IRMS instrumentation development. I gave a talk about our research on [impacts of changes in sea ice cover on Antarctic Benthic communities](https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/210019). Next year, Gilles and I will happily host the symposium in Li√®ge!
