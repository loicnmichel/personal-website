Bruno Frédérich and I co-first authored a paper about resource segregation in relatively poorly known nocturnal fishes from coral reefs in Madagascar. It's open access, so go read it on Zoological Studies' website: [Comparative Feeding Ecology of Cardinalfishes (Apogonidae) at Toliara Reef, Madagascar](http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/56/56-10.html)
