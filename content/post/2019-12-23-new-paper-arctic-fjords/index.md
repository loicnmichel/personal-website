New article out in Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences! For this paper, lead by [Maria Włodarska-Kowalczuk
](http://www.iopan.gda.pl/ekologia/mwk/mwk.html), we compared regional and local drivers of organic carbon fluxes in six fjords ranging from the North Atlantic (60°N) to the Arctic (81°N). Our results suggest that organic carbon content, origin and burial rates varied greatly according to latitude and presence of glacier inflow. This variability is important to take into account when trying to produce global estimates of fjord role in blue carbon storage, and for building scenarios of future climate change.
