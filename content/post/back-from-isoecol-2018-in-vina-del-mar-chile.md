I'm just back from the [IsoEcol 2018 conference](http://isoecol.com/2018/) in Viña del Mar. As always with IsoEcol, it's been a fantastic occasion to interact with leading experts in isotope ecology in a friendly and laid-back way, and to present our newest results to the isotope community. It was my third IsoEcol, and it's been good to catch up with old friends and colleagues, and to make a few new ones. It's been an inspiring week, choke-full of amazing talks and posters. It has also been an opportunity to discover beautiful (yet chilly) Chile. Thanks to the [Harrod lab](http://harrodlab.net/) and other organisers for a brilliant conference! Next IsoEcol will be in Vienna in 2020. I'm already looking forward!
