From 17 to 22/11/2018, the "[Lipids in the ocean: Structure, function, ecological role and applications"](https://marinelipids.sciencesconf.org/) conference took place in Brest. It was a pretty intensive week, starting   with workshops about sample preservation and storage; best practices to analyse lipid data; and how to couple lipid markers with stable isotopes (co-hosted by yours truly). After that, we had three days of very diverse talks. While exhausting, the conference was very rewarding. I've learned a lot and I am now full of new ideas to use lipid-based markers in the context of my research...
