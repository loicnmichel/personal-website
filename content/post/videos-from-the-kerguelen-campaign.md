During the [PROTEKER](http://www.proteker.net/?lang=en) campaign in Kerguelen Islands, as part of an outreach initiative, several videos were shot about the journey and the research program. One of them focuses specifically on my research (French only, sorry about that).

You can see all the other videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXPucz7oiNMFIttNjU7ov_Ed1FgvEMAzx). Unfortunately most are in French, but non-French speakers can still enjoy this one that focuses on the benthic ecosystems of the archipelago and whose soundtrack is only music.
