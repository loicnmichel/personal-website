On 28 and 29/03, I participated in the 2019 edition of the [Benelux Association of Stable Isotope Scientists (BASIS)](https://www.basis-online.eu/en/) annual symposium. The event was impeccably hosted by [our colleagues](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/marcel-van-der-meer) from the [Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ)](https://www.nioz.nl/en) on the lovely island of Texel. Both days were packed with great talks and posters, fruitful discussions with both familiar faces and new acquaintances, and even a tour of NIOZ' (very impressive) stable isotope lab. As always with BASIS, a very productive and pleasant experience. Already looking forward for the 2020 edition in Brussels!
