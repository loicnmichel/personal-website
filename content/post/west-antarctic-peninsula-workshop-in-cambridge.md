On 15 & 16/05, I took part in the 1st Workshop of the [Southern Ocean Observing System](http://www.soos.aq/) (SOOS) "West Antarctic Peninsula Regional Working Group", held at the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/) in Cambridge (UK). It's been a pleasure to attend the many high-quality talks, to participate in the discussions, and to discover the mythic BAS offices!
