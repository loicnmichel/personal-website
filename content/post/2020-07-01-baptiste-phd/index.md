Today, [Baptiste Le Bourg](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Baptiste_Le_Bourg) successfully defended his PhD thesis, entitled "Trophic ecology of Southern Ocean sea stars: Influence of environmental drivers on trophic diversity".

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the viva was held online. Despite the seemingly unavoidable technical issues, Baptiste did a great job, and both the new Dr. Le Bourg and his supervisors ([Gilles Lepoint](http://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/gilles-lepoint/) and I) are very happy about the outcome.

Baptiste's thesis is freely available at http://hdl.handle.net/2268/248221, so feel free to have a look.
