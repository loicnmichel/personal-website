On 19 and 20/04/2018, University of Liège hosted the [2018 symposium](http://www.basis-online.eu/en/en-basis-symposium-2018/) edition of the [Benelux Association of Stable Isotope Scientists (BASIS)](http://www.basis-online.eu/en/). Gilles Lepoint and I acted as local conveners. Although it has been two exhausting days, we are very happy with how things went. Turnout was very good for the conference (over 100 attendees), the atmosphere was friendly and the scientific level of the presentations was excellent. The symposium provided many opportunities for interactions between stable isotope users and people actually involved in instrumentation development. Thanks to the priceless help of reliable volunteers and of the BASIS board members, everything ran smoothly and pleasantly. We are already looking forward for the 2019 symposium!
