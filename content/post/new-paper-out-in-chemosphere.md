Our paper entitled "Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur and mercury concentrations as descriptors of trophic ecology and contamination sources of Mediterranean whales" just came out in Chemosphere. Co-lead by ULi√®ge's [Marianna Pinzone](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marianna_Pinzone) and [France Damseaux](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/France_Damseaux), this article shows that differences in dietary habits influence mercury contamination in Mediterranean cetaceans (sperm whales, fin whales and long-finned pilot whales).
