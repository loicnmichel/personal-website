Our new paper entitled "**Modelling species response to climate change in sub-Antarctic islands: echinoids as a case study for the Kerguelen Plateau**" is out in the [Proceedings of the 2nd symposium on the Kerguelen Plateau: Marine Ecosystems and Fisheries](http://heardisland.antarctica.gov.au/research/kerguelen-plateau-symposium/the-kerguelen-plateau-marine-ecosystems-and-fisheries). It is lead by [Thomas Sauc√®de](https://thomassaucede.wordpress.com/), who leads the [PROTEKER](http://www.proteker.net/?lang=en) research programme. This collaborative project, funded by the [French Polar Institute](https://www.institut-polaire.fr/language/en/) (IPEV) aims to assess impacts of global change on marine ecosystems of the Kerguelen Archipelago (Sub-Antarctic islands). Here, using sea urchins with contrasted ecological habits as model species, we explored ways to couple species distribution and isotopic niche models to gain a global view of species' realised niches, encompassing abiotic requirements as well as feeding preferences and ecological interactions. We believe this joint use holds great potential to help predict how species could adapt to future climate change.
