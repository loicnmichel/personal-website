In November 2018, we hosted the "[Lipids in the ocean: Structure, function, ecological role and applications"](https://marinelipids.sciencesconf.org/) conference in Brest. As part of a pre-conference workshop, we undertook the writing of collaborative review presenting the current state of knowledge of methods dedicated to both marine and freshwater lipid analyses, from sampling to data treatment. We aimed to provide lipid users with practical recommendations for best practices in field situations and advocate for protocol standardization and interlaboratory calibration.

Almost two years and countless hours of work after, the review, co-lead by [Lydie Couturier](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lydie_Couturier), [Philippe Soudant](https://www-iuem.univ-brest.fr/lemar/equipe/soudant-philippe/?lang=en), [Fabrice Pernet](https://annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/17057/en/) and myself, just came out in ICES Journal of Marine Science. We are thrilled to see this one out, and we are honored to have been selected as "Editor's choice"!
