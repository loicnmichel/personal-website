[Elementar](https://www.elementar.de/en.html) celebrated the launch of its new software, [ArDB (Analytical Results Database)](https://www.analyticalresultsdb.com/), with a competition to win a two-year licence. The challenge was to explain how one plans to use such a tool to develop new research in under a 100 words. I entered and was [selected among the winners](https://www.analyticalresultsdb.com/news/win-elementar-ardb-cloud-licence-and-smartwatch-winners-announced). I'm very thankful and thrilled to use this software to help developing our [upcoming open database](https://loicnmichel.wordpress.com/deepseabase/) of stable isotope ratios in deep-sea organisms.
