Our new paper is out in Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. We combined stable isotopes and gut contents to investigate how much macrofauna living in Neptune grass detritus accumulations actually feeds on dead seagrass fragments. Our results indicate that detritus is an important food source for primary consumers, and that detrital carbon is transferred to higher trophic levels through predation. These results complement those obtained by Mascart et al for meiofauna living in the same environment.
