I thought that it was past time to dust off my old wordpress website. I've decided to transition to a [github](https://github.com/)-hosted [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site, and built this one using the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) by [George Cushen](https://georgecushen.com/), which I cannot recommend warmly enough. It took me a while to adapt, but luckily there are many high-quality learning resources out there, making the process rather painless.

This new website is still under construction, and it might therefore look a bit rough around some edges, or contain a few dead links. I'm sorry about the inconvenience. Feel free to [drop me a line](/#contact/) if you notice anything weird.
