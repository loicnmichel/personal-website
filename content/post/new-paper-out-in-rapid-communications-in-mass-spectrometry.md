Our latest paper, entitled "[Isotopic half-life and enrichment factor in two species of European freshwater fish larvae: an experimental approach](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1002/rcm.7838/abstract)", just came out in the last issue of Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry. For this paper, we set up a lab experiment to measure isotopic turnover and trophic fractionation of carbon and nitrogen in larvae two species of common freshwater fish from river Meuse, the chub (_Squalius cephalus_) and the roach (_Rutilus rutilus_). It's the lead author (Adrien Latli, from UNamur) 's first paper, so congratulations Adrien! You can read the paper here: [http://hdl.handle.net/2268/208223](http://hdl.handle.net/2268/208223).
