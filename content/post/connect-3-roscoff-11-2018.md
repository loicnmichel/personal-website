From 14 to 16/11/2018, I participated at the 3rd French colloquium on biology and ecology of chemosynthesis-based ecosystems (CONNECT 3), hosted by the Roscoff biological station. It's been a great opportunity to meet the national community of hydrothermal vents and cold seeps researchers, and to present our lab's latest results.
