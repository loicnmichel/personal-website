Our new paper is out in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. We used stable isotopes to show that Baltic seagrass meadows offer a stable environment to macrofauna, dampening seasonal changes in the food web when compared with bare sediments. It is another product of the fruitful collaboration between [IOPAN](http://www.iopan.gda.pl/) (Gdansk, Poland) and [ULiège](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_8699436/en/portail-uliege) (Liège, Belgium).
