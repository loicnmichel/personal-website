We just received news that our project entitled "**Transfer of energy in hydrothermal vents - an _in situ_ experiment**" will be funded by [ISblue (Interdisciplinary graduate school for the Blue Planet)](https://www.isblue.fr/). Together with [Teresa Amaro](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Teresa_Amaro), [Gauthier Schaal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gauthier_Schaal), [Marjolaine Matabos](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marjolaine_Matabos) and [Jozée Sarrazin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jozee_Sarrazin), we will set up an deliberate isotopic tracer addition (pulse-chase) experiment in mussel beds from hydrothermal vents of the Mid-Atlantic ridge). In doing so, we aim to understand how symbiont-bearing Bathymodiolin mussels, that are considered foundation species, influence rates and pathways of carbon fixation in hydrothermal vent food webs . The experiment will likely be as challenging to set up as it is exciting. Stay tuned for more information!
