Our newest paper just came out in food webs. We used stable isotopes and fatty acid trophic markers to show that, despite the "black box" approach often applied to meiofaunal consumers, there is actually considerable interspecific differences in the feeding habits of copepods living in Mediterranean seagrass detritus. Moreover, our results show that some copepods could (quite unexpectedly) rely on seagrass detritus for their nutrition.

This is the last paper from Thibaud Mascart's PhD thesis, and it comes out quite timely as Thibaud now transitions into a less academic career. All the best to him for this new challenge!
