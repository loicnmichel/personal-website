Our paper entitled "[Similar levels of trophic and functional diversity within damselfish assemblages across Indo‚ÄêPacific coral reefs](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13076)", lead by [Laura Gajdzik](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura_Gajdzik), just came out in Functional Ecology. Using stable isotopes and functional diversity indices, we showed that patterns of ecological diversity are consistent in distinct damselfish assemblages found in very different Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Very happy to see this one out after a long, demanding and bumpy reviewing process... Congratulations, Laura!
