Our paper entitled "[Carbon, Nitrogen and Sulphur isotopic fractionation in captive juvenile hooded seal (_Cystophora cristata_](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.7955)[): application for diet analysis](https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.7955)" just came out in Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry. We took advantage of a rare opportunity to analyse tissues from Arctic seals raised on controlled diets to investigate diet-consumer isotopic fractionation in multiple tissues, and compare experimentally measured trophic enrichment factors to outputs from [SIDER](https://github.com/healyke/SIDER), a recently published model.
