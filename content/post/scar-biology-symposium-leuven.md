I just spent the week in Leuven for the excellent [12th Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Biology Symposium](https://kuleuvencongres.be/scarbiology2017/). Between a talk, a poster, a session to chair, scheduled project meetings and countless great presentations and fortuitous discussions, it has been a busy, productive, and very enjoyable week!
