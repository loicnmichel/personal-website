I started my scientific career with seagrass ecology. My PhD thesis' (2006-2011) main foci were the community structure, trophic diversity and functional role of amphipod mesograzers in Mediterranean *Posidonia oceanica* meadows. More recently, I participated in initiatives looking to understand how this seagrass' massive phytodetritus accumulations are used as habitat and/or food by meio- and macrofauna. I also took part in research focusing on polyspecific seagrass meadows from the Western Indian Ocean (Madagascar). Finally, through a collaboration with Polish colleagues, I also helped develop trophic markers-based approaches to advance knowledge of *Zostera marina* meadows from the Baltic Sea.
