Food webs form a complex network linking all organisms living in an ecosystem together. They can therefore acts as vectors, through which human-induced changes can propagate from one ecosystem compartment to another. In this context, part of my research focuses on impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems' structure and function.

From 2012 to 2014, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the STARESO research station (Calvi, Corsica, France), where I was in charge the scientific management of a locally funded mutli-institutional research programme focusing on multiscale anthropogenic impacts on Mediterranean coastal zones.

Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on links between direct (e.g. pollution by organic or inorganic contaminants, eutrophication or habitat modification) or indirect (global change) anthropogenic perturbations and ecological interactions and/or food web structure in multiple polar, temperate or tropical marine and/or freshwater ecosystems.
