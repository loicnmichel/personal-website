From 2014 to 2017, I was a Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) postdoctoral fellow at the [Laboratory of Oceanology](https://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/) (University of Li√®ge, Belgium) under [Gilles Lepoint](https://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/gilles-lepoint/). In the framework of the [vERSO (2013-2018)](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/brain-be/projects/vERSO_en.pdf) and [RECTO (2015-2020)](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/brain-be/projects/RECTO_en.pdf) inter-institutional projects, I took part in a collaborative effort to understand how stressors linked with global climate change (temperature, pH, sea ice cover) can influence benthic communities in the Southern Ocean. 

Since then, polar biology has become a strong component of my research. I'm notably interested on how changes in sea ice cover can drive food web structure and energy flows in benthic communities. I also study trophic plasticity in key Antarctic and Sub-antarctic consumers (sea stars, sea urchins, amphipods , seabirds and Notothenioid fishes) and how it can help animals to cope with environmental changes. More recently, I also had the opportunity to get involved on projects focusing on Arctic ecosystem changes.
