In the framework of the [vERSO and RECTO inter-institutional projects](http://rectoversoprojects.be/), I took part in a collaborative effort to understand how stressors linked with global climate change (temperature, pH, sea ice cover) can influence benthic communities in the Southern Ocean. I notably studied the impact of increased sea ice cover on benthic food web structure in Adélie Land (East Antarctica), as well as ecological plasticity in key Antarctic and Sub-antarctic consumers (Sea stars, sea urchins, amphipods , seabirds and Notothenioid fishes). Most of this work is still ongoing, and was initiated during my time (2014-2017) as a Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) postdoctoral fellow at the [Laboratory of Oceanology](http://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/) (University of Liège, Belgium) under [Gilles Lepoint.](http://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/gilles-lepoint/)
