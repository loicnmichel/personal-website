Since September 2017, I'm a research scientist at the [Deep Environment Laboratory](http://wwz.ifremer.fr/deep/) of [Ifremer Brittany](http://wwz.ifremer.fr/en), Brest, France. My main current focus is the study of trophic interactions among deep-sea benthic communities. More info on this research coming soon!
