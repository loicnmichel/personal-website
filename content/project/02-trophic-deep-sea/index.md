Since September 2017, I'm a research scientist at the [Deep Environment Laboratory](http://wwz.ifremer.fr/deep/) of [Ifremer Brittany](http://wwz.ifremer.fr/en), Brest, France.

Ongoing projects include ecological plasticity of foundation species in cold seeps ecosystems, food web structure in hydrothermal vents from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Pacific back-arc basins, as well as trophic interactions in cold water coral reefs. I'm also building an [open database for stable isotope ratios of deep-sea fauna](/deepseabase/).

More info on this research coming soon!
