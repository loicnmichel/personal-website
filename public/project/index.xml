      <title>Polar benthic systems &amp; global change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the framework of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rectoversoprojects.be/&#34;&gt;vERSO and RECTO inter-institutional projects&lt;/a&gt;, I took part in a collaborative effort to understand how stressors linked with global climate change (temperature, pH, sea ice cover) can influence benthic communities in the Southern Ocean. I notably studied the impact of increased sea ice cover on benthic food web structure in Adélie Land (East Antarctica), as well as ecological plasticity in key Antarctic and Sub-antarctic consumers (Sea stars, sea urchins, amphipods , seabirds and Notothenioid fishes). Most of this work is still ongoing, and was initiated during my time (2014-2017) as a Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (BELSPO) postdoctoral fellow at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/&#34;&gt;Laboratory of Oceanology&lt;/a&gt; (University of Liège, Belgium) under &lt;a href=&#34;http://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/gilles-lepoint/&#34;&gt;Gilles Lepoint.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trophic interactions in deep-sea ecosystems</title>
      <link>/project/02-trophic-deep-sea/</link>

      <guid>/project/02-trophic-deep-sea/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since September 2017, I&#39;m a research scientist at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwz.ifremer.fr/deep/&#34;&gt;Deep Environment Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wwz.ifremer.fr/en&#34;&gt;Ifremer Brittany&lt;/a&gt;, Brest, France. 
My main current focus is the study of trophic interactions among deep-sea benthic communities. More info on this research coming soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Stable isotopes as ecological tracers</title>
      <link>/project/03-stable-isotopes-in-ecology/</link>

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

I started to use stable isotope ratios of light biogenic elements (C, N and S) as ecological tracers at the beginning of my PhD thesis, and quickly grew interested in their wide range of applications in environmental sciences. Over the years, and in the context of a number of fruitful academic collaborations, I developed extensive theoretical, practical and analytical knowledge of stable isotopes. From 2014 to 2017, alongside Gilles Lepoint, I co-managed University of Liège’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://labos.ulg.ac.be/oceanologie/recherches/isotopes-stables/&#34;&gt;stable isotope facility&lt;/a&gt;. I’m also a guest lecturer at University of Liège, where Gilles and I co-teach a course about stable isotope and their use in marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I successfully used stable isotopes to solve questions in fields ranging from ecophysiology to organic matter fluxes and biogeochemistry. I worked with many model species groups (seagrasses, invertebrates, fishes, marine mammals and seabirds) originating from marine or freshwater ecosystems of tropical, temperate and polar regions. I also grew familiar with most common stable isotope data analysis tools, including mixing models, ecological niches metrics, isotopic diversity indices and trophic position estimation models. When possible, I try to combine stable isotopes with other techniques such as gut content analysis, or with other trophic markers such as fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides climate change and its impacts in Antarctica, part of my research focused on direct impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems&amp;rsquo; structure and function. From 2012 to 2014, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the STARESO research station (Calvi, Corsica, France), where I was in charge the scientific management of a locally funded mutli-institutional research programme focusing on multiscale anthropogenic impacts on Mediterranean coastal zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, I had the opportunity to work with colleagues focusing on marine ecotoxicology, and to help them explore how animal feeding ecology influences their contamination by persistent organic pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Seagrass meadows and associated food webs</title>
      <link>/project/05-seagrass-ecology/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/05-seagrass-ecology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my scientific career with seagrass ecology. My PhD thesis&amp;rsquo; (2006-2011) main foci were the community structure, trophic diversity and functional role of amphipod mesograzers in Mediterranean &lt;em&gt;Posidonia oceanica&lt;/em&gt; meadows. More recently, I participated in initiatives looking to understand how this seagrass&amp;rsquo; massive phytodetritus accumulations are used as habitat and/or food by meio- and macrofauna. I also took part in research focusing on polyspecific seagrass meadows from the Western Indian Ocean (Madagascar). Finally, through a collaboration with Polish colleagues, I also helped develop trophic markers-based approaches to advance knowledge of &lt;em&gt;Zostera marina&lt;/em&gt; meadows from the Baltic Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
