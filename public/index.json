This study investigates the long‐term effects of four preservation methods on isotopic compositions and isotopic niche parameters of sea stars.\nMethods: We assessed the effects of preservation method (freezing, drying, formaldehyde, ethanol) and duration (0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 months) on the stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur of sea star tissues. Isotopic ratios were measured using continuous‐flow elemental analysis and isotope ratio mass spectrometry. We also monitored the evolution of commonly used ecological metrics (isotopic niche parameters) throughout the experiment.\nResults: Clear changes in δ13C values were observed for samples stored in formaldehyde and ethanol. None of the preservation methods had significant or consistent effects on δ15N values. Formaldehyde preservation induced a decrease in δ34S values. All these changes could be mitigated using correction factors. Isotopic niche parameters slightly changed over time when computed with δ13C and δ15N values, but inconsistent variations occurred when computed with δ13C and δ34S values.\nConclusions: Overall, these results show that preservation may affect the stable isotope ratios of sea stars. Correction factors can be used to mitigate the effects of the preservation method on stable isotope ratios. Isotopic niche parameters are overall unchanged. Consequently, in most cases, museum samples are suitable for calculation of isotopic niche parameters.","tags":["2020"],"title":"Effects of preservation methodology on stable isotope compositions of sea stars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dehnhard N.","Achurch H.","Clarke J.","Michel L.

Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species.\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter‐ and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences.\nWe used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation‐maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross‐validation.\nDuring incubation and chick‐rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day—partly during incubation and completely during chick‐rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best‐explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds.\nOur results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio‐temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey—even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.","tags":["2020"],"title":"High inter‐ and intraspecific niche overlap among three sympatrically breeding, closely related seabird species: Generalist foraging as an adaptation to a highly variable environment?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Włodarska‐Kowalczuk M.","Mazurkiewicz M.","Górska B.","Michel L.

This study aims to identify regional and local drivers of variability of Corg burial in north Atlantic and Arctic fjords. We provide a comparative quantiﬁcation of Corg, δ13C, photosynthetic pigments content, benthic biomass, consumption, Corg accumulation, and burial rates in sediments in six fjords (60–81°N). Higher sediment Corg content in southern Norway reﬂected longer phytoplankton growth season and higher productivity. Higher contributions of terrestrial Corg were noted in temperate/southern Norway (dense land vegetation and high precipitation) and Arctic/Svalbard (glacial erosion) than in subarctic/northern Norway locations. Benthic biomass and carbon consumption were best correlated to δ13C and photosynthetic pigments content indicating control by quality rather than quantity of available food. Benthic faunal consumption did not seem to affect the variability in Corg burial. Regional environmental factors (water temperature and latitude) combined with local factors (Corg, grain size, and pigment concentration) explained 94% of Corg burial variability. Based on the present study and literature data on Corg content, origin, and burial rates, the fjords were classified into four categories: temperate, subarctic, Arctic with glaciers, and Arctic without glaciers. The variability in marine productivity, terrestrial inﬂows, and carbon sequestration in fjords must be considered for global estimates of their role in blue carbon storage and for building scenarios of future changes in the course of climate warming.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Organic carbon origin, benthic faunal consumption, and burial in sediments of northern Atlantic and Arctic fjords (60–81°N)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pinzone M.","Damseaux F.","Michel L.

The extremely high levels these animals present demand for an urgent understanding of such processes and the development of new analytical techniques that go beyond the simple contamination monitoring. It was often proposed that prey selection or habitat use may affect Hg contamination in animals; however, it was never possible to measure which factor influences more rates and pathways of contamination. In this paper, we directly integrate toxicological information (Hg levels) and ecological tracers (stable isotopes of C, N and S) into a common data analysis framework (isotopic niches), with the aim of quantifying the influence of species’ trophic behaviour on Hg contamination. The analysis was conducted on skin biopsies of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas and sperm whales Physeter microcephalus. Their different trophic modes and residency in the area make them model species for the analysis of Hg accumulation along NWMS food webs. We measured Total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations through absorbance spectrometry with the DMA80 Milestone. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotope compositions were measured via mass spectrometry in an IRMS coupled to an Elemental Analyser (EA) Isoprime. Comparison of ecological and contamination niches allowed to explain Hg accumulation in Mediterranean marine predators. Factors such as food web complexity, trophic position, hunting distribution or habitat use (e.g., foraging depth) did not influence Hg exposure. It is rather the selection of prey type, which determines the range of potential Hg sources and as a consequence the rates of accumulation in whales’ tissues. A generalist piscivorous species such as the pilot whales will bioaccumulate more Hg than specialised sperm whales feeding mostly on cephalopods.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur and mercury concentrations as descriptors of trophic ecology and contamination sources of Mediterranean whales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pizzochero A.

Moreover, some of its biological traits (long life span, inshore feeding, high trophic position) make this species a suitable sentinel of coastal pollution. Here, we investigated contamination by multiple legacy and emerging organic pollutants, such as brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), in whitemouth croakers from two estuaries (Guanabara and Sepetiba Bays) located in industrialized and urbanized areas in Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we assessed how biological and ecological features could explain the observed contamination patterns. Regarding brominated flame retardants, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) varied from 7.6 to 879.7 pg g-1 wet weight (w.w.), with high contribution of tetra-, penta-, hexa- and deca-BDEs. The sum of chlorinated flame retardants (dechlorane-related compounds, ΣDRC) ranged from -1 w.w., mostly represented by Dechlorane 603 and Dechlorane Plus (DP). Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs varied from -1 w.w., while the Toxic Equivalent (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 pg g-1 w.w. Positive correlations between δ15N and concentrations of tri-, tetra- and penta-BDEs, as well as ΣDRC, DP and anti-DP isomers suggested that ecological factors (namely biomagnification along the food web) influence contamination of whitemouth croakers in the estuaries studied. Moreover, the sum of PBDEs (ΣPBDE), tri- and tetra-BDEs concentrations were negatively correlated with fish size, suggesting that depuration by fishes and/or habitat shift throughout the whitemouth croaker's life cycle might also influence concentrations. Overall, our study emphasized the need for further investigations to help understand the complex patterns of bioaccumulation and biomagnification that seem to exist in Southeastern Brazil.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Occurrence of legacy and emerging organic pollutants in whitemouth croakers from Southeastern Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Papers"],"content":"New paper about Antarctic seabirds, lead by Nina Dehnhard, just out in Journal of Animal Ecology.

The genus Oncholaimus is known to tolerate extreme geothermal conditions and high sulphide concentrations in shallow water hydrothermal vents, but it was only occasionally reported in deep-sea vents. In this study, we performed morphological, genetic and ecological investigations (including feeding strategies) on an abundant species of Oncholaimus recently discovered at Lucky strike vent field on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at 1700 m water depth.\nResults: We described this species as *Oncholaimus dyvae* sp. nov. This new species differs from all other members of the genus by the combination of the following characters: body length (up to 9 mm), the presence of a long spicule (79 μm) with a distally pointed end, a complex pericloacal setal ornamentation with one precloacal papilla surrounded by short spines, and a body cuticule with very fine striation shortly posterior to the amphid opening. Overall, $O. dyvae$ sp. nov. abundance increased with increasing temperature and vent emissions. Carbon isotopic ratios suggest that this species could consume both thiotroph and methanotrophic producers. Furthermore sulfur-oxidizing bacteria related to Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were detected in the cuticle, in the digestive cavity and in the intestine of *O. dyvae* sp. nov. suggesting a potential symbiotic association.\nConclusions: This study improves our understanding of vent biology and ecology, revealing a new nematode species able to adapt and be very abundant in active vent areas due to their association with chemosynthetic micro-organisms. Faced by the rapid increase of anthropogenic pressure to access mineral resources in the deep sea, hydrothermal vents are particularly susceptible to be impacted by exploitation of seafloor massive sulfide deposits. It is necessary to document and understand vent species able to flourish in these peculiar ecosystems.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Ecology and trophic role of *Oncholaimus dyvae* sp. nov.

To understand ecological implications of these environmental changes, we studied benthic food web structure on the coasts of Adélie Land during an event of unusually high sea ice cover (i.e. two successive austral summers without seasonal breakup). We used integrative trophic markers (stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur) to build ecological models and explored feeding habits of macroinvertebrates. In total, 28 taxa spanning most present animal groups and functional guilds were investigated. Our results indicate that the absence of seasonal sea ice breakup deeply influenced benthic food webs. Sympagic algae dominated the diet of many key consumers, and the trophic levels of invertebrates were low, suggesting omnivore consumers did not rely much on predation and/or scavenging. Our results provide insights about how Antarctic benthic consumers, which typically live in an extremely stable environment, might adapt their feeding habits in response to sudden changes in environmental conditions and trophic resource availability. They also show that local and/or global trends of sea ice increase in Antarctica have the potential to cause drastic changes in food web structure, and therefore to impact benthic communities.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Increased sea ice cover alters food web structure in East Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"New paper out!

We compared two benthic communities in an Arctic fjord: a species‐rich community (in an outer basin) and an impoverished community (in a glacially impacted bay) and explored (1) if high species richness was translated into high functional trait richness and (2) if high taxonomic and functional diversity promoted high trophic diversity in terms of resource use (indicated by isotopic niche measures). We documented higher functional trait richness in the outer basin (computed based on traits describing feeding mode, mobility, food source, body size and life habit), but the area occupied by consumers in the δ15N vs. δ13C iso‐space (a proxy for total trophic resource use) did not differ between the two sites. A wide array of functional traits used to acquire food may extend the benthic community trophic niche spatially (where and how animals forage) without impacting the isotopic niche breadth (in this system, mostly reflecting “what animals feed on”) due to the relatively homogenous distribution of isotopic characteristics of detritus pool across vertical scales in marine sediments. Moreover, this trend could indicate that a species‐poor community tends to exploit all the available food items, possibly due to the low food availability for primary consumers in a glacially impacted environment. Communities in glacial bays could therefore be particularly sensitive to future changes in glacial inputs and associated organic matter fluxes.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Is the trophic diversity of marine benthic consumers decoupled from taxonomic and functional trait diversity?

Human have drastically modified freshwater habitats, notably for navigation purposes. Such modifications may drastically affect food availability for young of the year (YOY) fish and, consequently, influence their ability to reach the adult age. In the River Meuse, a decrease of fish abundance is thought to be linked to a drastic decrease of phytoplankton biomass. In this context of lowering phytoplankton biomass, we quantified the trophic niches of three cyprinid species (common bleak *Alburnus alburnus*, chub *Squalius cephalus*, and roach *Rutilus rutilus*) and one percid species (European perch *Perca fluviatilis*) at various stages of development, in order to estimate the influence of river channelization in the intra and interspecific competitions. It was done using stable isotope analysis in two reaches of the River Meuse differing by their degree of regulation. We hypothesized that habitat heterogeneity increases YOY abundance over time by offering more alternative resources which reduce food competition, notably during the early period of life. Our study provides evidence that the River Meuse flow and depth regulation significantly impacted the abundance and taxonomic diversity of YOY. In the context of low planktonic biomass, most YOY relied on benthic food sources. In the heavily channelized reach, between-stages competition and low resource diversity increased the diet partition between cyprinid larvae and forced a part of individuals to consume non-optimal energetic food sources such as aquatic vegetation. On the other hand, in the less channelized reach, larvae displayed a generalist feeding habit focusing on energetic prey such as different taxa of macroinvertebrates, suggesting that the diversity of habitat reduces the food competition within and between stages and the predation risk. Developing a sustainable and integrated river management may be useful for protecting biodiversity and restoring ecosystem function, in order to improve the ecological potential of regulated rivers.","tags":["2019"],"title":"River habitat homogenisation enhances trophic competition and promotes individual specialisation among young of the year fish","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saucède T.","Guillaumot C.","Michel L.

Species distribution models (SDM) can represent a convenient tool to predict the biogeographic response of species to climate change but biotic interactions are not considered in these models. Nevertheless, new species interactions can emerge in communities exposed to environmental changes and the structure of biotic interactions is directly related to the potential resilience of ecosystems. Trophic interaction studies can help predict species vulnerability to environmental changes using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios to generate trophic models. Using new available data inputs, we generated robust SDM and trophic interaction models to assess the potential response and sensitivity of three echinoid species to future worst-case scenarios of environmental change in the Kerguelen Plateau region. The two modelling approaches provide contrasting insights into the potential responses of each species to future environmental changes with both approaches identifying Abatus cordatus to be particularly vulnerable due to its narrow ecological niche and endemism to near-shore areas. Coupling insights gained from trophic niche ecology with species distribution modelling represents a promising approach that can improve our understanding and ability to predict the potential responses of species to future habitat changes.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Modeling species response to climate change in Sub-Antarctic islands: Echinoids as a case study for the Kerguelen Plateau","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"2019 starts well, as our new paper was just published in Freshwater Biology.

The density and biomass of seagrass meadows (*Z. marina*) together with associated macrophytes undergo substantial seasonal changes, with clear declines in winter. The present study aims to test whether the seasonal changes in the density of recovering seagrass meadows affect the benthic food webs of the southern Baltic Sea (Puck Bay). It includes meiofauna, macrofauna and fish of vegetated and unvegetated habitats in summer and winter seasons. Two levels of organization have been tested – species-specific diet preferences using stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) in Bayesian mixing models (MixSIAR) and the community-scale food web characteristics by means of isotopic niches (SIBER). Between-habitat differences were observed for grazers, as a greater food source diversity in species from vegetated habitats was noted in both seasons. Larger between-habitat differences in winter were documented for suspension/detritus feeders. The community-wide approach showed that the differences between the habitats were greater in winter than in summer (as indicated by the lower overlap of the respective isotope niches). Overall, the presence of seagrass meadows increased ecological stability (in terms of the range of food sources utilized by consumers) in the faunal assemblage, while invertebrates from unvegetated areas shifted their diet to cope with winter conditions. Therefore, as a more complex system, not sensitive to seasonal changes, *Z. marina* meadows create a stable habitat with high resilience potential.","tags":["2019"],"title":"Stabilizing effects of seagrass meadows on coastal water benthic food webs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Elementar celebrated the launch of its new software, ArDB (Analytical Results Database), with a competition to win a two-year licence.

Dead seagrass leaves are often exported outside the seagrass beds and may form accumulations (exported macrophytodetritus accumulations, hereafter EMAs) from littoral zones to deepest canyons. Understanding how seagrass organic matter is channeled in its associated trophic web is necessary to assess the role of the seagrass ecosystem as blue carbon service providers. We used gut content and stable isotope analyses to delineate the Posidonia oceanica EMA food web structure and to determine the importance of detrital material in the diets of macrofauna. Evidence from gut contents and stable isotopes showed that this food web is fuelled mainly by two food sources found in the detritus accumulations: 1) *P. oceanica* detritus itself and 2) epiphytes and drift macroalgae. Dead leaves of *P. oceanica* enter the diet of dominant species, representing more than 60% of animal abundance. The food web is structured in five trophic levels with a numerical dominance of detritivore/herbivore species at the first consumer level. Animals act as a vector for seagrass organic matter transfer to upper trophic levels and this “dead seagrass signal” is followed through the entire food web. Seagrass primary production and seagrass organic matter processing by animals are spatially decoupled and this should be taken into account in assessments of seagrass ecosystems as key actors in C cycles in coastal areas.","tags":["2018"],"title":"Seagrass organic matter transfer in *Posidonia oceanica* macrophytodetritus accumulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our new paper is out in Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology.

Nevertheless, ecological factors driving copepod co-existence and population dynamics are still largely unknown. Here, we aimed to explore feeding habits of four copepod species commonly found in Mediterranean seagrass detritus accumulations, representing distinct eco-morphotypes (planktonic, phytal, epibenthic and mesopsammic). Joint use of fatty acid and stable isotope trophic markers showed that co-occurring harpacticoid copepods have diversiﬁed diets. Contrary to what was expected, microphytobenthos does not serve as their main food source. Instead, we found evidence from both techniques that major food items include heterotrophic biomass, macro-epiphytes and, depending on eco-morphology and season, of seagrass detritus-derived organic matter. Isotopic niches suggested that eco-morphotypes showed resource segregation. This segregation varies temporally, and partial overlap occurs between niches of phytal and epibenthic eco-morphotypes in some seasons. Our results highlight that, contrary to what is often assumed for meiofaunal consumers, considerable trophic diversity exists among copepod assemblages. They also indicate that, through multiple non-exclusive possible mechanisms, copepods could constitute a major link between seagrass detritus and associated biomass and higher trophic levels (namely macroinvertebrates and juvenile ﬁsh).","tags":["2018"],"title":"Seasonal dependence on seagrass detritus and trophic niche partitioning in four copepod eco-morphotypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pizzochero A.

Currently, the accelerating loss of these habitats is recognized worldwide. In the southern Baltic Sea, a natural recovery of *Zostera marina* meadows has occurred after a dramatic reduction within the last century. The aim of this study is to understand if and how the recovering eelgrass meadows affect the functioning of benthic ecosystems. The trophic links within the benthic food webs in the seagrass meadows and bare sandy bottoms were depicted and compared. The trophic connections were examined by combining stable isotope (SI) composition (δ13C, δ15N) and fatty acid (FA) profiles of meio- and macrofauna consumers and of potential food sources (particulate organic matter, surface sediment organic matter, epiphytes, microphytobenthos/bacteria and macrophytes) in a Bayesian mixing model framework (MixSIAR). Significantly higher amounts of the FA bacterial marker (C18:1ɷ7) were observed in meiofauna (approximately 40%) than in the macrofauna (1% on average), suggesting that bacteria are an important part of the meiofauna diet. The mixing model results indicated that the benthic consumers in the vegetated habitat utilized more food sources (e.g., epiphytes in the diets of meiofauna and macrofaunal grazers) and thus had a more diverse diet. Macrofaunal omnivores relied to a larger degree on animal-derived organic matter in vegetated habitat, which could be linked to higher invertebrate prey availability. The results highlight the importance of recovering seagrass meadows in driving the mechanisms responsible for food web organization. Any type of change to the state of seagrass meadows is crucial to the functioning and stability of marine ecosystems.","tags":["2018"],"title":"Modification of benthic food web structure by recovering seagrass meadows, as revealed by trophic markers and mixing models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our newest paper just came out in food webs.

Despite recent advances in coral reef community ecology, a more comprehensive knowledge about processes (niche-related traits and phylogenies) driving the composition of reef fish community is needed. Here, we conducted a quantitative comparison of these processes in damselfish assemblages that belong to three distinct Indo-Pacific coral reefs differing in taxonomic composition, morphology and degree of human disturbance. We compiled a dataset of eight categorical variables to estimate functional diversity of damselfish assemblages and a second one of stable isotope ratios to evaluate isotopic diversity, a proxy of trophic diversity. Both datasets represent the eco-functional diversity and provide insights into niche-related traits. Indices were then computed to grasp complementary facets of this diversity: the size of multidimensional space (richness), the partitioning of niches (divergence) and the regularity in the distribution of niches (evenness) within each space. We also tested whether functional and trophic traits displayed some evolutionary niche conservatism. We found that functional richness was influenced by the number of species and functional entities (unique combination of trait values), and that the portions of the functional spaces filled by assemblages mainly overlapped. Functional divergence and evenness indices were similarly high. For trophic diversity, the isotopic richness remained equivalent, while the two other indices were of high values and did not significantly differ. Both functional and trophic traits did not display any phylogenetic conservatism. We demonstrated consistent levels of eco-functional diversity in Indo-Pacific coral reef damselfishes. Each assemblage hosted species whose niches were highly differentiated and evenly distributed in eco-functional spaces of similar sizes, albeit the extent of functional space varied with the species richness. Assemblages also tended to share similar functional attributes. The inconsistent phylogenetic structures of eco-functional traits and the similarity in diversity indices suggest that the assemblage composition of damselfishes is mainly driven by niche-related processes rather than by phylogenetic relatedness. Our work helps to determine which mechanisms shape coral reef fish biodiversity and more particularly assemblages issued from replicated events of ecological radiation. A plain language summary is available for this article.","tags":["2018"],"title":"Similar levels of trophic and functional diversity within damselfish assemblages across Indo-Pacific coral reefs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Since September 2017, I'm a research scientist at the Deep Environment Laboratory of Ifremer Brittany, Brest, France.\nOngoing projects include ecological plasticity of foundation species in cold seeps ecosystems, food web structure in hydrothermal vents from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Pacific back-arc basins, as well as trophic interactions in cold water coral reefs.

Rationale: Intrinsic biogeochemical markers, such as stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur, are increasingly used to trace the trophic ecology of marine top predators. However, insufficient knowledge of fractionation processes in tissues continues to hamper the use of these markers. Methods: We performed a controlled feeding experiment with eight juvenile hooded seals (Cystophora cristata) that were held on a herring-based diet (Clupea harengus) for two years. Stable isotope ratios were measured via isotope ratio mass spectrometry in three of their tissues and related to values of these markers in their diet. Results: Diet-tissue isotope enrichment (trophic enrichment factor, TEF) values between dietary herring and seal tissues for carbon (Δ 13 C) were +0.7 ‰ for red blood cells, +1.9 ‰ for hair and +1.1 ‰ for muscle. The TEFs for nitrogen trophic (Δ 15 N) were +3.3 ‰ for red blood cells, +3.6 ‰ for hair and +4.3 ‰ for muscle. For sulphur, the Δ 34 S values were +1.1 ‰ for red blood cells, +1.0 ‰ for hair and +0.9 ‰ for muscle. Conclusions: These enrichment values were greater than those previously measured in adult seals. This increase may be related to the higher rate of protein synthesis and catabolism in growing animals. This study is the first report on sulphur isotope enrichment values for a marine mammal species.","tags":["2017"],"title":"Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotopic fractionation in captive juvenile hooded seal (Cystophora cristata): Application for diet analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Frédérich","Loïc N.

Many damselfishes (Pomacentridae) are herbivorous or omnivorous with an important contribution from different kinds of algae in their diet. they display different levels of territoriality and farming behavior, from almost non territorial to monoculture farmers. In addition, a few species inhabit seagrass meadows but, presently, none can be considered as seagrass-eating specialists. the footballer demoiselle, Chrysiptera annulata, is found in the seagrass meadows on the reef flat of the Great Reef of Toliara (Madagascar, Mozambique Channel). In the light of this unusual habitat for a pomacentrid, this study aimed to answer three questions: 1) What is the diet of C. annulata? 2) Do the resources supporting this diet include seagrass? 3) Does its trophic niche overlap those of other sympatric damselfishes (Pomacentrus trilineatus, Chrysiptera unimaculata and Plectroglyphidodon lacrymatus) living in close association with macrophytes or eating algae? Stomach content examination and stable isotope analysis showed that the footballer demoiselle is not a seagrass consumer but is an omnivorous/herbivorous species heavily relying on algal resources and small invertebrates. SIAR, a stable isotope mixing model, indicated it assimilated large amounts of turf algae, and various benthic or planktonic invertebrates in lower proportions. SIBER metrics revealed that the isotopic niche of the footballer demoiselle partly overlaps that of its congener, C. unimaculata, but not those of P. trilineatus and P. lacrymatus. trophic strategies of C. annulata differed both from farming species such as P. lacrymatus and from less territorial herbivores such as P. trilineatus. Its seagrass meadow habitat on the Great Reef of Toliara allows the conquest of an unusual habitat for damselfishes and could limit competition with C. unimaculata, a species displaying the same territorial behavior and the same isotopic niche but living on the reef itself.","tags":["2016"],"title":"Trophic ecology of the seagrass-inhabiting footballer demoiselle textitChrysiptera annulata (Peters, 1855); comparison with three other reef-associated damselfishes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gilles Lepoint","Laurent Bernard","Sylvie Gobert","Loïc N.

Sharks are believed to play a significant role in marine ecosystems, although their specific trophic ecology is largely unexplored. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) are a widely applied tool in food-web studies, but there is a need to quantify stable isotope dynamics in animals, particularly sharks. In this study, diet-tissue discrimination factors (DTDF = stable isotope in consumer tissue - stable isotope in diet) and turnover rates (time for the isotope to be assimilated into the consumer’s tissue) of stable isotopes were estimated in blood, fin, and muscle tissue for the shark species *Scyliorhinus stellaris* fed 2 diets with different isotope values. Subsequently, these diet- and tissue-specific DTDFs were used in isotopic mixing models to quantify the diet of *Scyliorhinus canicula* caught in the North Sea and were compared with stomach content data. DTDFs for δ15N (Δ15N) and δ13C (Δ13C) ranged from -1.95 to 3.49‰ and from 0.52 to 5.14‰, respectively, and varied with tissue and diet type. Isotope turnover rates in plasma and red blood cells, expressed as half-lives, ranged from 39 to 135 days. Most of the variability in DTDFs reported in this and other studies with sharks can be explained by linear relationships between DTDF and dietary isotopic values. From these relationships, we propose a method for isotope mixing models using diet-specific DTDFs, which improves diet reconstruction estimates for animals, particularly mesopredator sharks that consume a large range of prey types.","tags":["2013"],"title":"Diet-and tissue-specific incorporation of isotopes in the shark *Scyliorhinus stellaris*, a North Sea mesopredator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jansen O.

Stranded porpoises were collected along the Dutch coast (2006–2008) and their diet was assessed through stomach content and stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) of porpoise muscle and prey. Stable isotope analysis (SIAR) was used to estimate the contribution of prey species to the porpoises’ diet. This was compared to prey composition from stomach contents, to analyze differences between long- and short-term diet. According to stomach contents, 90.5% of the diet consisted of gobies, whiting, lesser sandeel, herring, cod, and sprat. Stable isotope analysis revealed that 70-83% of the diet consisted of poor cod, mackerel, greater sandeel, lesser sandeel, sprat, and gobies, highlighting a higher importance of pelagic, schooling species in the porpoises’ diet compared to stomach contents. This could be due to prey distribution as well as differences in behavior of porpoises and prey between the coastal zone and offshore waters. This study supports the need for multi-method approaches. Future ecological and ﬁshery impact assessment studies and management decisions for porpoise conservation should acknowledge this difference between the long- and short-term diet.","tags":["2013"],"title":"Diet of harbor porpoises along the Dutch coast: A combined stable isotope and stomach contents approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parmentier E.","Michel L"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1365120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1365120000,"objectID":"d73903d1720b90253a642fa034102949","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2013parmentiersymb/","publishdate":"2020-02-22T09:51:32.588946Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2013parmentiersymb/","section":"publication","summary":"Symbiosis can take different forms (parasitism, mutualism, commensalism, etc.) but boundaries between different types of symbiotic interactions are not well defined. The kinds of symbiotic associations between organisms cannot however be restricted to isolated and distinct categories. These associations are part of a broad continuum in which it is difficult to know where one type of association ends and another begins. Moreover, different scientists use the same term to mean different things or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure what is biologically important and what is not. This communication proposes a new classification scheme, which simply and comprehensively illustrates relationships between the various kinds of associations. The scheme illustrates relationships clearly and highlights the continuum between types of associations. It further indicates where modifications to the scheme are possible over time. The classification of the association between two organisms can be reduced to two factors: 1) the impact incurred by the host (benefit or damage) and 2) the relative duration of the association (RDA), i.e. the ratio of the duration of the association to the life expectancy of the symbiont. The conceptual figure provides concrete examples and illustrates some relationships that can change during different life stages. This figure should help teachers and students in the understanding of symbiosis, and could be a starting point for future discussions in the continuously developing research fields studying ecological and evolutionary implications of symbiotic relationships.","tags":["2013"],"title":"Boundary lines in symbiosis forms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jansen O.

To study their trophic level and feeding location, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N) were analysed in muscle and bone samples collected from 157 porpoises stranded along the Dutch coast (2006-2008). In addition, samples from 30 prey species were analysed. Prey samples showed high δ15N values in species of higher trophic level. In addition, geographic differences in isotopic composition were found, with higher δ15N and δ13C values in prey from more southern, coastal and estuarine areas. Based on muscle δ15N values, we found neonatal enrichment and that larger porpoises, in particular males, seem to feed on lower trophic level species, compared to smaller individuals. Also bone δ15N values show that larger animals had fed on lower trophic levels in distant times. Porpoises from the Eastern Scheldt reveal distinct δ13C values in muscle, but not in bone. This shows that these animals had foraged in the Eastern Scheldt for a longer time period but were not born there. Seasonal variation in bone δ15N and δ13C values revealed two distinct groups of porpoises along the Dutch coast, a winter group (mainly males) that migrated from neighbouring regions and a Dutch subpopulation in summer. These results furthered our insight about shifts in trophic level and feeding location of harbour porpoises from the southern North Sea over time.","tags":["2012"],"title":"Feeding ecology of harbour porpoises: stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in muscle and bone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michel L.","Lepoint G.","Dauby P.","Sturaro N"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"139b16fdfa4b273b8e18f36e826d0119","permalink":"/publication/journal-article/2010michelcrus/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2010michelcrus/","section":"publication","summary":"Efficient sampling of amphipod crustaceans associated with *Posidonia oceanica* (L.)

Each of the methods shows specific advantages and disadvantages, hence the most important feature to consider in the choice of the method would be its adequacy with regard to the study purpose.
