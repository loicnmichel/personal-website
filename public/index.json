To understand ecological implications of these environmental changes, we studied benthic food web structure on the coasts of Adélie Land during an event of unusually high sea ice cover (i.e. two successive austral summers without seasonal breakup). We used integrative trophic markers (stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur) to build ecological models and explored feeding habits of macroinvertebrates. In total, 28 taxa spanning most present animal groups and functional guilds were investigated. Our results indicate that the absence of seasonal sea ice breakup deeply influenced benthic food webs. Sympagic algae dominated the diet of many key consumers, and the trophic levels of invertebrates were low, suggesting omnivore consumers did not rely much on predation and/or scavenging. Our results provide insights about how Antarctic benthic consumers, which typically live in an extremely stable environment, might adapt their feeding habits in response to sudden changes in environmental conditions and trophic resource availability. They also show that local and/or global trends of sea ice increase in Antarctica have the potential to cause drastic changes in food web structure, and therefore to impact benthic communities.","tags":null,"title":"Increased sea ice cover alters food web structure in East Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"New paper out!

We compared two benthic communities in an Arctic fjord: a species‐rich community (in an outer basin) and an impoverished community (in a glacially impacted bay) and explored (1) if high species richness was translated into high functional trait richness and (2) if high taxonomic and functional diversity promoted high trophic diversity in terms of resource use (indicated by isotopic niche measures). We documented higher functional trait richness in the outer basin (computed based on traits describing feeding mode, mobility, food source, body size and life habit), but the area occupied by consumers in the δ15N vs. δ13C iso‐space (a proxy for total trophic resource use) did not differ between the two sites. A wide array of functional traits used to acquire food may extend the benthic community trophic niche spatially (where and how animals forage) without impacting the isotopic niche breadth (in this system, mostly reflecting “what animals feed on”) due to the relatively homogenous distribution of isotopic characteristics of detritus pool across vertical scales in marine sediments. Moreover, this trend could indicate that a species‐poor community tends to exploit all the available food items, possibly due to the low food availability for primary consumers in a glacially impacted environment. Communities in glacial bays could therefore be particularly sensitive to future changes in glacial inputs and associated organic matter fluxes.","tags":null,"title":"Is the trophic diversity of marine benthic consumers decoupled from taxonomic and functional trait diversity?

Species distribution models (SDM) can represent a convenient tool to predict the biogeographic response of species to climate change but biotic interactions are not considered in these models. Nevertheless, new species interactions can emerge in communities exposed to environmental changes and the structure of biotic interactions is directly related to the potential resilience of ecosystems. Trophic interaction studies can help predict species vulnerability to environmental changes using carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope ratios to generate trophic models. Using new available data inputs, we generated robust SDM and trophic interaction models to assess the potential response and sensitivity of three echinoid species to future worst-case scenarios of environmental change in the Kerguelen Plateau region. The two modelling approaches provide contrasting insights into the potential responses of each species to future environmental changes with both approaches identifying Abatus cordatus to be particularly vulnerable due to its narrow ecological niche and endemism to near-shore areas. Coupling insights gained from trophic niche ecology with species distribution modelling represents a promising approach that can improve our understanding and ability to predict the potential responses of species to future habitat changes.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling species response to climate change in Sub-Antarctic islands: Echinoids as a case study for the Kerguelen Plateau","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"2019 starts well, as our new paper was just published in Freshwater Biology.

I worked with many model species groups (seagrasses, invertebrates, fishes, marine mammals and seabirds) originating from marine or freshwater ecosystems of tropical, temperate and polar regions. I also grew familiar with most common stable isotope data analysis tools, including mixing models, ecological niches metrics, isotopic diversity indices and trophic position estimation models. When possible, I try to combine stable isotopes with other techniques such as gut content analysis, or with other trophic markers such as fatty acids.\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"14a27796f2c0cdb4625e14b3c3c5dd4a","permalink":"/project/03-stable-isotopes-in-ecology/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/03-stable-isotopes-in-ecology/","section":"project","summary":"I started to use stable isotope ratios of light biogenic elements (C, N and S) as ecological tracers at the beginning of my PhD thesis, and quickly grew interested in their wide range of applications in environmental sciences.

Delile meadows is difficult, due to their complex community structure and to the heterogeneity of the meadows. Here we compare three sampling techniques: the hand-towed net, the air-lift, and light traps. Each of the methods shows specific advantages and disadvantages, hence the most important feature to consider in the choice of the method would be its adequacy with regard to the study purpose. Moreover, the most accurate way to sample amphipods from P. oceanica meadows could be to combine several methods, keeping in mind their respective strengths and weaknesses, and to adapt the sampling protocol to the aims of the study at issue.","tags":null,"title":"Sampling methods for amphipods of Posidonia oceanica meadows: a comparative study","type":"publication"}]
