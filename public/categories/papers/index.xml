      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right on time for the holiday break, our newest paper is out in Elementa: Science of the Anthropocene. It was lead by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gustavo_Yunda-Guarin&#34;&gt;Gustavo Yunda-Guarin&lt;/a&gt;, as part of his PhD research at Laval University (Québec, Canada). It is part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenedgeproject.info/&#34;&gt;Green Edge project&lt;/a&gt; special issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this paper, we combined stable isotopes and lipid trophic markers to show that sea ice-derived production is an important energy source for deep-sea benthos in the Canadian Arctic. This suggests that changes in spring sea ice phenology could alter benthic food-web structure.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2018, we hosted the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://marinelipids.sciencesconf.org/&#34;&gt;Lipids in the ocean: Structure, function, ecological role and applications&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; conference in Brest. As part of a pre-conference workshop, we undertook the writing of collaborative review presenting the current state of knowledge of methods dedicated to both marine and freshwater lipid analyses, from sampling to data treatment. We aimed to provide lipid users with practical recommendations for best practices in field situations and advocate for protocol standardization and interlaboratory calibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost two years and countless hours of work after, the review, co-lead by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lydie_Couturier&#34;&gt;Lydie Couturier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www-iuem.univ-brest.fr/lemar/equipe/soudant-philippe/?lang=en&#34;&gt;Philippe Soudant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://annuaire.ifremer.fr/cv/17057/en/&#34;&gt;Fabrice Pernet&lt;/a&gt; and myself, just came out in ICES Journal of Marine Science. We are thrilled to see this one out, and we are honored to have been selected as &amp;ldquo;Editor&#39;s choice&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Environmental stress, productivity and functional diversity - new paper in Ecology</title>
      <link>/post/new-paper-hydrothermal-vents/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/new-paper-hydrothermal-vents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very happy to share this new paper just out in Ecology! It was lead by &lt;a href=&#34;https://alfarolucas.wixsite.com/deepecology&#34;&gt;Joan Alfaro-Lucas&lt;/a&gt;, as part of his PhD research at Ifremer. Here&#39;s how he pitches it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we used hydrothermal vents as natural labs, because they are hotspots of primary productivity and biomass where productivity correlates partially with environmental stress, radically contrasting with the surrounding stable and energy-limited deep sea. At vents, altered seawater is emitted as vent fluid, which is hot, acidic, depleted of oxygen and has toxic compounds. Microorganisms however use some toxic and other compounds of fluids to produce energy in a process known as chemosynthesis. Despite the associated stress, chemosynthesis fuels dense communities of well-adapted invertebrates found nowhere but in vents. In the literature, vents are often referred as oases or islands in the deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that despite stress, faunal assemblages under high hydrothermal influence were functionally more diverse than those in more stable surrounding areas without direct influence of vent emissions. The opposite trend has been observed in shallow-water vents! Contrary to their shallower counterparts, deep vents are hotspots of evolutionary novelties. We suggest that concomitant productivity increases with stress can lead to the presence of well-adapted &amp;amp; functionally diverse assemblages in the deep-sea energetic-limited context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we hypothesized that high functional diversity, that is, more distinct ecological functions among taxa, could lower interspecific competition, and facilitate species coexistence in high densities, in the spatially restricted vent areas. We raise awareness on the poorly known vent peripheral areas that showed low functional diversity and trait clustering. These assemblages, with also unique species and functional entities may be specially affected by anthropogenic activities such as deep-sea mining.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New paper on Antarctic amphipods</title>
      <link>/post/new-paper-antarctic-amphipods/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/new-paper-antarctic-amphipods/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New paper out in Antarctic Science! For this one, we looked at mouthpart morphology in several species of Southern Ocean amphipods. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether the tremendous ecological diversity found in Antarctic amphipods, that occupy many different ecological niches and hold an important place in food webs, was reflected in their mandible morphology, and if mouthpart specialization could be used to describe amphipod feeding habits. It turns out that while mandible morphology adequately depicted some aspects of amphipod trophic ecology (e.g. degree of dietary specialization, trophic position), links between mandible morphology and amphipod diet were seldom unambiguous or straightforward. Overall, mandible morphology on its own was generally not sufficient to precisely predict amphipod feeding strategies. However, when combined with other methods (e.g. gut contents, trophic markers), it constitutes a valuable source of information for integrative studies of amphipod ecological diversity in the Southern Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New paper about hydrothermal vent shrimps</title>
      <link>/post/new-paper-hydrothermal-shrimps/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a few quiet months of cancelled conferences, postponed cruises, and home working, I&#39;m very happy to share some news about a new publication. This paper, just published in Royal Society Open Science, is the output of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pierre_Methou&#34;&gt;Pierre Methou&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s thesis at Ifremer, that focused on emblematic, symbiont-bearing, hydrothermal vent shrimps &lt;em&gt;Rimicaris&lt;/em&gt; spp. Here, we combined integrative taxonomy (morphological analyses, DNA sequencing) and ecological markers (stable isotopes of C, N and S) to re-examine ontogenic niche shifts and interspecific differences in resource use among &lt;em&gt;R. exoculata&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;R. chacei&lt;/em&gt;. It turns out that while both species transition from photosynthesis-based nutrition towards a chemosynthetic diet after settlement, there is consistent niche segregation between the two species throughout their life cycle. Those results provide a good illustration of the identification issues persisting in deep-sea ecosystems and the importance of integrative taxonomy in providing an accurate view of fundamental aspects of the biology and ecology of species inhabiting these environments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New paper: impact of fluid preservation on sea stars stable isotope ratios</title>
      <link>/post/new-paper-preservation-seastars/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/new-paper-preservation-seastars/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New article out in Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry! This paper is the first output of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Baptiste_Le_Bourg&#34;&gt;Baptiste Le Bourg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s PhD thesis at ULiège. Baptiste&#39;s PhD focuses on Southern Ocean sea stars. For part of his work, we were keen to use sea stars sampled during past campaigns and archived in lab or museum collections. However, these samples are typically stored in fluid preservatives (formaldehyde and/ or ethanol), which can influence their stable isotope composition. Here, we performed a 2-year experiment on the temperate sea star &lt;em&gt;Marthasterias glacialis&lt;/em&gt;, and monitored how different modes of preservation would alter its stable isotope ratios of C, N, and S. Our results showed that the preservation method indeed affected stable isotope ratios, but that correction factors could be used to mitigate those biases. Therefore, under some conditions, fluid-preserved sea stars can be used for trophic ecology studies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New paper about carbon fluxes in Arctic fjords</title>
      <link>/post/new-paper-arctic-fjords/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/new-paper-arctic-fjords/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New article out in Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences! For this paper, lead by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iopan.gda.pl/ekologia/mwk/mwk.html&#34;&gt;Maria Włodarska-Kowalczuk
&lt;/a&gt;, we compared regional and local drivers of organic carbon fluxes in six fjords ranging from the North Atlantic (60°N) to the Arctic (81°N). Our results suggest that organic carbon content, origin and burial rates varied greatly according to latitude and presence of glacier inflow. This variability is important to take into account when trying to produce global estimates of fjord role in blue carbon storage, and for building scenarios of future climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/new-paper-in-journal-of-animal-ecology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New paper about Antarctic seabirds, lead by &lt;a href=&#34;https://ninadehnhard.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Nina Dehnhard&lt;/a&gt;, just out in Journal of Animal Ecology. We combined GPS logging and stable isotopes to understand how Antarctica’s tremendous seasonal variability affected habitat and food segregation among closely related and sympatrically breeding species. Results suggest that all three species have a generalist behaviour and exhibit considerable isotopic niche overlap. This might be explained by the optimal foraging theory: in a very productive but highly variable such as coastal Antarctica, being a generalist, although it increases risks of interspecific competition, might be essential to efficiently exploit mobile prey stocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
